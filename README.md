Install this *now* to opt-in to achievements from various packages.

**Package Developers**: Achievements can be submitted by any package using the `achievement:unlock` event.
This package takes care of storing the user's state of achievement so you don't have to.
Read on for more details!

## Grant Achievements to Your Users!

Achievements can be triggered using the `achievement:unlock` event:

```CoffeeScript
atom.emitter.emit "achievement:unlock",
  name: "So many scripts, so little time!"
  requirement: "Run a script while another is still running"
  category: "runners"
  package: "script"
  points: 200
  iconURL: "http://i.imgur.com/qRXoLmE.png"
```

The name is what uniquely identifies the achievement.
